Success in a hackathon, a moment to treasure,
Where passion and talent find boundless pleasure.

So let us embrace this hackathon's call,
With determination and courage, we stand tall.
For success is not just a fleeting prize,
But a journey of growth, where innovation lies.

Creating solutions that will pave the day.
Success is our mantra, our guiding star,
As we code, collaborate, and raise the bar.
